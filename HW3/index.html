                    "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike 
                    men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
                    moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
                    that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
                    duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking
                    from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
                    In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing 
                    prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed
                    and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of
                    duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
                    to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
                    these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure 
                    other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
